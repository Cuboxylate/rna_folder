# Implementation of base-pair maximising algorithm to predict RNA secondary structure. 
 
#### Input: 
Filename and path as a single argument. File contains RNA sequence 
of a, u, g, c, space, cr and line break characters. Sample RNA sequences 
can be found in ./tests.

#### Output:
The sequence in three columns: index, base at index, base paired with 
base at index. -1 denotes unpaired base. Default prints to System.out. 

For an explanation of how the algorithm works and what it is trying to 
achieve, please see the included pdf article I authored.
